              <p>When I'm working on a project, I think a lot about the message I want to convey, the tools I use, and doing the right thing.

               <p>My grasp of the role of rhetoric in design has deepened. I now appreciate how the art of persuasion is not just about language but also about how visual elements can influence perception and decision-making. Learning to leverage design principles effectively, I've become more skilled at crafting messages that resonate with my audience, understanding that every color choice, font selection, and layout decision carries rhetorical weight.

        <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
           <p>In my class where I learned about writing and design, I picked up some really important stuff about how to communicate well, use technology, and think about ethics in my designs. First off, I got better at using language and visuals to tell a story about my designs, making sure my ideas were clear and catchy. Then, there was the tech part. Learning some coding skills opened up a whole new world for me, especially in web and digital design. It's amazing how much you can do with the right tech tools to create and show off your designs. Lastly, the ethics side of things really made me think. I learned to be mindful of how my designs affect people and the planet. This meant making sure my designs were fair, easy for everyone to use, and didn't harm the environment. It was all about bringing together good communication, cool tech, and thoughtful design to make something that really matters.</p>

         <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
           <p>Applying design principles like balance, contrast, and unity was crucial in my work.

I learned how to make my designs more coherent, user-friendly, and visually appealing.</p>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
          <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
           <p>Engaging in a workshop environment was transformative for me. Collaborating with peers, exchanging ideas, and receiving feedback enriched my learning experience. Facilitating a research workshop particularly enhanced my leadership and communication skills, vital for collaborative design processes.</p>

           <p>I practiced revising my designs across different media forms, which helped me understand the unique demands of each medium. This practice was essential for developing my versatility as a designer and taught me how different strategies are required for digital, print, or interactive media.</p>
 </div>
     
 <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
           <p>Presenting my work effectively was as crucial as the design process itself. I honed my skills in articulating my ideas clearly, showcasing my designs engagingly, and responding constructively to feedback. These presentation skills were key in persuading and impressing stakeholders, clients, or peers about the effectiveness of my designs.</p>
